# 7 Real Stories of Social Engineering Attacks on Social Media (Volume 1)  

Social media isn’t just where we post selfies or scroll newsfeeds — it’s a goldmine for attackers who thrive on manipulating human behavior. Social engineering is all about exploiting trust, curiosity, and urgency.  

Here are **seven true stories** of how attackers used social media to get what they wanted — and the lessons we can take from each.  

---

## 1. The Fake Job Offer on LinkedIn  
In 2022, attackers posed as recruiters offering cybersecurity roles at major firms. They messaged professionals on LinkedIn with polished profiles and realistic job descriptions, including “attachments” that were actually malware.  
**Lesson:** Don’t download unsolicited files, even from people who look legitimate. Verify recruiters before engaging.

## 2. The Instagram Brand Partnership Scam  
An influencer was promised a paid clothing collaboration. To finalize the deal, she was asked to log into a “creator portal.” The site was a phishing page that stole her Instagram login, allowing attackers to hijack her account and scam her followers.  
**Lesson:** Ambition makes us vulnerable. Never log into third-party sites with your main credentials.

## 3. The Twitter Crypto Giveaway  
In 2020, high-profile Twitter accounts like Elon Musk and Apple were hacked. Attackers tweeted a “Bitcoin giveaway” that promised double returns. Thousands fell for it, and attackers walked away with over $100,000 in crypto.  
**Lesson:** If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Verified accounts can still be compromised.

## 4. The Facebook “Urgent Family Member” Scam  
Attackers messaged people pretending to be their relatives in emergencies — “I lost my wallet, please send money.” Using profile pictures and details scraped from public posts, they convinced victims to wire funds.  
**Lesson:** Always confirm requests through another channel. A phone call can save thousands.

## 5. The Snapchat Sextortion Scheme  
Teens were tricked into sharing intimate photos through fake Snapchat accounts posing as peers. Attackers then threatened to release the images unless victims paid money.  
**Lesson:** Social engineers weaponize shame. Never share sensitive material online, and report extortion attempts immediately.

## 6. The LinkedIn Corporate Espionage Play  
A foreign intelligence group created fake profiles of executives and sent connection requests to employees of defense contractors. Once connected, they messaged staff with malware-laced “industry reports.”  
**Lesson:** Not all networking is safe. Be cautious about who you connect with, especially if their profile looks too perfect.  

---

## 7. The TikTok “Giveaway Portal” Trick  
A viral TikTok trend offered followers “exclusive giveaways” through links in bios. The portals captured usernames, passwords, and even two-factor codes. Dozens of accounts with large followings were stolen and sold.  
**Lesson:** Attackers exploit trends. Don’t trust links outside of official brand pages.
